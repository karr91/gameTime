Creating a browser game based off the classic Breakout. 

User will manouver a bar at the bottom of the screen to bounce a ball up and into a section of bricks.
User will score points for number of bricks destroyed.
User will start with 3 lives.
After user has lost 3 lives the score will be displayed and the game will be over. 





# Future ideas

Different Color bricks that take multiple hits to break.
A way to increase number of lives at different score marks.


# Harder ideas

Bricks drop power ups or extra balls
