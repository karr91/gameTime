Creating a browser game based off the classic Breakout. 

1. Player loads page and is prompted by the start button which is clickable.
2. Player clicks start and the game begins
3. Ball moves up to the bricks and bounces off of them destroying them in the process and increasing the score by 1.
4. Player uses paddle to bounce the ball back up towards the bricks.
5. Player tries to keep the ball up to break all the bricks.
6. If the ball falls below the paddle into the deadzone the player will lose a ball.
7. If all three balls are lost the game is over and the score will be shown on the end screen.
8. If the player successfuly destroys all the bricks the game will end and the max score end screen will be shown
